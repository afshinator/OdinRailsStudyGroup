**Objectives**

+ Main goal of this group is to provide value above and beyond what you'd get if you were to go through the material purely on your own.  

	Let's leverage each other for teaming up, answering questions, and venting!

	Use the Google Odin Community page to get in touch with other Odinators!

	###### If you're into it, send me your email, I'll make a mail list so you can reach each other during the week

+ We are NOT going over the reading & projects in the hangout as if I'm teaching it.  You're going to have to do all the reading on your own.  However, I encourage x amount of group coding on the projects especially if you're stuck.

+ We ARE 

	going to meet weekly, go over last weeks efforts, revise schedule if need be.

	going to use my experience / hear my opinions around learning Rails, Ruby, & CS in general - hopefully to your benefit.
