### Why Rails?

- There's a variety of web technology frameworks out there.  How many of you even considered learning .Net or
    Spring, or Laravel?   What?? you never even heard of them?

- Here's some [good discussion around learning **Django vs. Rails**](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-vs-Python/Which-should-I-learn-Django-or-Rails)

- Let's talk about **Node.js**, its javascript on the server (instead of in a browser), plus
 
    Express.js is a web application server that runs on Node.  It has yet to take over the world... however,

	*Node.js* shines in real-time web applications employing push technology over websockets. Why is that interesting? For over 20 years we've had this stateless-web based on the paradigm of the stateless request-response architecture (like REST); Node web applications can have real-time, two-way connections, where either the client or server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data at will. This is in contrast to the typical web response paradigm, where the client always initiates communication. Additionally, it’s all based on the open web stack (HTML, CSS and JS)...

	Using non-blocking, and event-driven I/O, it remains lightweight and **efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications** that run across distributed devices.  
    
    It's definitely a rising star among technologies, another reason being that javascript itself continues to rise.

- **Rails** lets you build and change web apps quickly.  Its open source, well-documented, has a thriving & hip
	community, runs on Ruby (which is known as a programmer friendly language), lets you interface well with the front-end, often used 
	along with test-driven agile paradigm, and [more secure than most](http://youtu.be/2Ex8EEv-WPs).   

	It's a mature, stable product that has proven its value.  As opposed to node, **it shines in cases where the
	business logic aspects of the application are heaviest** (e-commerce, membership sites, content management, custom database solutions, ...)
