### Why Rails?

- There's a variety of web technology frameworks out there.  How many of you even considered learning .Net or
    Spring, or Laravel?   What?? you never even heard of them?

- Here's some [good discussion around learning **Django vs. Rails**](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-vs-Python/Which-should-I-learn-Django-or-Rails)

- Let's talk about **Node.js**, its javascript on the server (instead of in a browser), plus
 
    Express.js is a web application server that runs on Node.  It has yet to take over the world... however,

	*Node.js* shines in real-time web applications employing push technology over websockets. Why is that interesting? For over 20 years on the web we've had this paradigm of the stateless request-response architecture (REST) based on the client initiating requests to the server as the model for how things should work; Node web applications can have real-time, two-way connections, where either the client or server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data at will. Additionally, itâ€™s all based on the open web stack (HTML, CSS and JS)... [read more here](http://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js)

	Using non-blocking, and event-driven I/O, it remains lightweight and **efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications** that run across distributed devices.  
    
    It's definitely a rising star among technologies, another reason being that javascript itself continues to rise.

- **Rails** lets you build and change web apps quickly.  Its open source, well-documented, has a thriving & hip
	community, runs on Ruby (which is known as a programmer friendly language), lets you interface well with the front-end, often developed using the modern test-driven agile paradigm, and [more secure than most](http://youtu.be/2Ex8EEv-WPs). 

	It's a mature, stable product that has proven its value.  As opposed to node, **it shines in cases where the
	business logic aspects of the application are heaviest** *(examples: e-commerce, membership sites, content management, custom database solutions, ...)*

### Ruby-isms    

- [Hashes](http://richonrails.com/articles/working-with-ruby-hashes), symbols, and procs - get used to them, they're everywhere


- **Common idioms all over rails**:

	Colon placement can be confusing.  Must pay attention to placement. Here is an example from ```routes.rb``` :

	```resources :posts```

	- Whats is :posts?  Its a symbol.  We're passing a symbol to the resources method.

	Another example from routes.rb

	```root to: "welcome#index"```

	- Here, 'root' is a method being called with a hash with key 'to' and value "welcome#index" string.

	Now in a view : 

	```<%= form_for :post, url: posts_path do |f| %>```

	- form_for is a method being passed :post symbol, and a hash with key 'url',
	but first ```posts_path``` 'helper' method is being passed a block, which resolves to the value
	for key value 'url'.
	
	And another : 

	```render text: params[:post].inspect```

	- ```render``` is a method being passed a hash which has key 'text', the value of which is the result of running the ```inspect``` method on the params hash, whose key value :post is being accessed!  Got that?
