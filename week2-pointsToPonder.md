### Why Rails?

- There's a variety of web technology frameworks out there.  How many of you even considered learning .Net or
    Spring, or Laravel?   What?? you never even heard of them?

- Here's some [good discussion around learning **Django vs. Rails**](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-vs-Python/Which-should-I-learn-Django-or-Rails)

- Let's talk about **Node.js**, its javascript on the server (instead of in a browser), plus
 
    Express.js is a web application server that runs on Node.  It has yet to take over the world... however,

	*Node.js* shines in real-time web applications employing push technology over websockets. Why is that interesting? For over 20 years on the web we've had this paradigm of the stateless request-response architecture (REST) based on the client initiating requests to the server as the model for how things should work; Node web applications can have real-time, two-way connections, where either the client or server can initiate communication, allowing them to exchange data at will. Additionally, itâ€™s all based on the open web stack (HTML, CSS and JS)... [read more here](http://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js)

	Using non-blocking, and event-driven I/O, it remains lightweight and **efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications** that run across distributed devices.  
    
    It's definitely a rising star among technologies, another reason being that javascript itself continues to rise.

- **Rails** lets you build and change web apps quickly.  Its open source, well-documented, has a thriving & hip
	community, runs on Ruby (which is known as a programmer friendly language), lets you interface well with the front-end, often developed using the modern test-driven agile paradigm, and [more secure than most](http://youtu.be/2Ex8EEv-WPs). 

	It's a mature, stable product that has proven its value.  As opposed to node, **it shines in cases where the
	business logic aspects of the application are heaviest** *(examples: e-commerce, membership sites, content management, custom database solutions, ...)*

### Take a look at [Week 1 Points to Ponder](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-pointsToPonder.md)

### Take a look at the [HTTP & REST review](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week2-HTTP.md)

// The rest of this is for advanced beginners

### Ruby-isms    

- hashes, get used to them, they're everywhere

	http://richonrails.com/articles/working-with-ruby-hashes
	
- symbols,  get used to them quick because they're everywhere. 

	

- Common idioms all over rails:

	Colon placement can be confusing.  Rails Guides example (5.0) in the router shows

		```resources :posts```

	Whats is :posts?  Its a symbol.

	Next line in the routes file shows

		```root to: "welcome#index"```

	Here, 'root' is a method being called with a hash with key 'to' and value "welcome#index" string.

	Now looking in 5.2...

		```<%= form_for :post, url: posts_path do |f| %>```

	form_for is a method being passed :post and a hash, and a block  (??????)
	posts_path is a method too (a 'helper' type), its result is attached as the value of the key url


	Now in 5.3...

	  	```render text: params[:post].inspect```

	render is a method being passed a hash; key 'text', while the value is the result of running the
	inspect method on the params method which returns an object which allows access to its keys using
	symbols (or strings).
