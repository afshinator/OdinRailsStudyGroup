### What is the Odin Project?  
// Show screenshot of Odin home page.
- **A free on-line resource for learning web development**, uses 2 methods:

    1. The website provides an extended curriculum that covers learning web development through primarily
    free on-line resources.  It covers the range of things you need to know as a software developer
    working on web technologies, from the technical details of front-end and back-end coding, to HTTP,
    to career advice, and more.  Its focus is on programming; specifically Ruby and the Rails framework
	on the back-end, and Browser and Javascript related technologies on the front.

	2. The website itself is a Rails app and an open source project, and is constantly evolving with the
	help of students, and of course direction from the founder/developer of the site 
	[Erik Trautman](http://www.theodinproject.com/contact).

	We use agile inspired methodology to run sprints to implement speced out features, often pairing or 
	in a group, to write test-driven code.  You get to exercise what you learn in the curriculum in a 
	real production app - you can see your work on line literally the next day. See the 
	[Contribution Page on Odin](http://www.theodinproject.com/contributing).

    3. This studygroup itself is an off-shoot student project.  Check the studygroup page, linked to at top.

### We are here to learn **Ruby on Rails**
// Show screenshot of [Rails section of Odin](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons)
- We want to take a deep dive so that we can implement our own apps.  No one tutorial can go in as deep as we need; not even Hartl's.  We have to use a variety of resources, over a range of time.

- Our knowledge & learning of Rails will go in ever-increasing concentric circles where we cover the same material over and over again from different angles, each time getting a bigger understanding of the picture.  

	So really, we're here to learn Rails and all the periphery technology that it entails.

- Week 1 had a scheduling snafu! All the participants were advanced beginners; most are already experienced students of Odin's curriculum.  



### What are the skill levels of the participants this week?
// How many people of each of are there?
	
- I expect some total beginners, a few I've-done-a-tutorials, and maybe a couple of intermediates.

- Total Noobs, especially those who havent read the 
	[How this Course Will Work](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/how-this-course-will-work)
	need to do so to cover the pre-reqs to get the most out of our efforts.  You can follow along at will, but you might hurt from lack of programming/Ruby knowledge that you get from earlier course material.

- Hope-fully some have rails installed and have at least started a tutorial, know some rails.  They need to 
	read the How this course will work, and finish Hartl's Chpt 2.  Do Rails Guides' and Blogger2 tutorials.

- Folks from last week are all at least advanced beginners. Hang tight, I'll address you guy specifically a little later.



### Identify Your Group to know which assignments to do...
// I'm assuming there's going to be a split between these two types...

#### You're a Beginner if ...

- Have not coded much in Ruby at all / Have done less than 7 chapters in Hartl / Don't know the difference between client and server / don't know difference between HTTP and MVC / ...


#### You're an Advanced Beginner if ...

- Even though you have to look up specifics, you're comfortable with Ruby / You've completed either the Rails Guide's Getting Started tutorial or JumpStart Lab Blogger2, or at least 6 chapters in Hartl / ...



### Any questions on Installation, Rails in general, Nitrous, ... ?
// Pull up a logged in session of Nitrous, show code editor, ...
- Quick explanation of how Nitrous is nice for collaboration efforts. There's also Koding, Codebox, and more - haven't explored those yet but would like to.

- Get a GitHub account asap.  

- Read [my advice from last week](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-transcript.md#advice).


### Time for this weeks [**Points to Ponder**](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week2-pointsToPonder.md)
// go over *Why Rails?* from this weeks points

// might want to go over [week1 points](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-pointsToPonder.md) based on audience, skip GET & POST because [HTTP points](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week2-HTTP.md) covers it.



### This weeks assignment for Beginners

- Read [How this Course Will Work](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/how-this-course-will-work)
    to get oriented and understand the prep-work you should cover.

- Go over all files from last week, especially, read [Week #1 transcript](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-transcript.md),
 it includes what was covered, links, ... 

    I comment about how you *do* really need to have Ruby knowledge for Rails. So at minimum, ...
    
    **Do [Learn To Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)**, chapter 1 - 10.  It's quick, it'll raise your understanding of Ruby.  Also this synchronizes you with the Odin Wed Dev 101 study group if you care to jump in there as well.
    
    Do chapters 1 & 2 of [Hartl's Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book); gets your feet wet.  You can skip the material on installation if you're already set up.
    
    If you're finished with these already, do [last weeks assignments]().


### Newfangled App Starters

- [Rails Composer](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/)

- [Rails Bricks](http://www.railsbricks.net/)

	ADVICE: Pound for pound, as a beginner, you will be learning more Rails by reading and diving into the Rails curriculum than by using these auto-generators.  Having said that, they *can* be very useful epecially if you want to see how some popular gems are used, or just want to tweak models, views, routes, the db, etc... to see results.

    If time permits, use each of these to slap together a project just for the experience.

**At this point, Beginners can keep listening or go home, we'll be addressing Advanced Beginners and folks from last week...**

### Let's go over last weeks assignment

- Details in [week 1 transcript](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-transcript.md#assignment1)


### This weeks assignment for Advanced Beginners

- We've all done at least a bunch of chapters in Hartl... What do you think is the hardest stuff to learn?

	Testing (syntax, what to test, what not to test, when to test)

	Associations

	what else??

- Let's get well grounded in testing and RSpec. 

- **Read** [Odin's Project Ruby page](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby) and

- **Do** at least the first 7 [Test First Ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby) problems.

	The goal of this exercise is to get comfortable with RSpec.  We're taken out of the context of Rails and left to deal with just spec-driven Ruby.  After you finish, 


- **Read** this [BetterSpecs.org RSpec best-practices article](http://betterspecs.org/).

- **Do** [chapters 1 & 2 of Hartl](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/)

	After you finish chpt 2, think about what tests you would write.

- **Read** [How We Test Rails Applications](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications) from *thoughtbot*

- **Look** at and use the [simplecov gem](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) if time permits; it's a [code coverage](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1158518/what-is-code-coverage) tool.
