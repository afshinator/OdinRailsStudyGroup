#### Objectives

+ Main goal of this group is to provide value above and beyond what you'd get if you were to go through the material purely on your own.  

	Let's leverage each other for teaming up, answering questions, and venting!

	Use the Google Odin Community page to get in touch with other Odinators!

	###### If you're into it, send me your email, I'll make a mail list so you can reach each other during the week.

+ We are NOT going over the reading & projects in the hangout as if I'm teaching it.  You're going to have to do all the reading on your own.  However, I encourage x amount of group coding on the projects especially if you're stuck.

+ We ARE 

	- going to meet weekly, go over last weeks efforts, revise schedule if need be.

	- going to use my experience / hear my opinions around learning Rails, Ruby, & CS in general - hopefully to your benefit.

	<a name="advice"></a>**Advice #1** : Hartl is of the opinion that you can learn Rails w/o much understanding of Ruby.  My observation is that without knowledge & experience of 1. Ruby, 2. Programming in general, you'll at best become good at building what the tutorials build, and will lack the know-how to implement your own original ideas.

	**Advice #2** : While following the tutorials, embrace the side projects like getting up to speed in github, getting on Heroku & deploying often.  ( Lack of Github skills will continuously hinder you.   Heroku deployment is simple but can also be a land-mine (asset issues!). )


#### Paraphrasing the [How This Course Will Work](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/how-this-course-will-work) section

+ This portion of the Odin curric will be the most build-heavy
+ You'll be asked to read docs, check out blog posts, watch videos, run marathons
+ Projects will be the major focus
+ Related/included technologies: HTTP, MVC, REST, APIs, Cookies and Authentication

+ **Prerequisites** - that section oulines installing, back-end secion of web dev 101, basic Ruby, Rails overview, and our first assignment!

	- Software installation - **Necessary stuff**: Ruby, Rails, Git & Github account, eventually Heroku account

	- Installation is non-trivial and time-consuming stuff.  [InstallFest](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/installations) 

	- **If for whatever reason, you can't install Rails**, you can use online IDE's, our weapon of choice at this time: [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/)

	- Even if your local dev environment is all set up, get a Nitrous account anyway, you'll use it when group coding with others in this track and throughout Odin project efforts.

#### The [Rails portion of the Web Dev 101](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails-basics) section kicks off our Rails learning

+ A **quick video tour** of what has been done with Rails... We'll just watch from 0:50 to ~2:45 in the hangout
	[Video with Hartl showing popular sites that run on Rails](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_DJdmvBStE)


+ **Points to ponder** - You'll learn this stuff in detail in the curric; let's do a once-over...

	See [week1.pointsToPonder.md](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-pointsToPoinder.md)

<a name="assignment1"></a>
+ **Homework Possibilities** -- from least to most time consuming
	
	- **Hartl's Tutorial - Chpt 2** [Scaffold app](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/a-demo-app#top)

	- **Ruby On Rails Guides:** [Getting Started](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

	The [edge version](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/guides/source/getting_started.md)
 of this tutorial is cleaned up quite a bit, *follow that instead*.	

	- **Blogger 2** [Jumpstart Lab project](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)


	##### Add [annotate_models gem](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models) to whichever one we do.

	##### Special Reading - [Setting up a Rails app for TDD](http://www.startuprocket.com/blog/how-to-setup-a-rails-app-for-test-driven-and-behavior-driven-development-with-rspec-and-capybara-webkit) Article


+ **Regexps** -- [Regular Expressions](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-regex.md); embrace the pain.

#### **Odds & Ends**


- [astonj's opinionated guide to learning Ruby and Rails](http://astonj.com/tech/best-way-to-learn-ruby-rails/)

	Good links to a variety of books, ...

	He's a big proponent of learning Ruby first, and learning it well  (as opposed to Hartl's opinion)
	

- [Free audiocast I'd like to find out about](http://www.buildingwebapps.com/learningrails) - any takers?

- [Code Learn](http://www.codelearn.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial) - Another one I don't know about

- [markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#wiki-code), 
and [another](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html)

- [dilinger.io](http://dillinger.io/) - It uses a different font than Github!  Otherwise useful.
