### What is the Odin Project?  
// Show screenshot of Odin home page.
- **A free on-line resource for learning web development**, uses 2 methods:

    1. The website provides an extended curriculum that covers learning web development through primarily
    free on-line resources.  It covers the range of things you need to know as a software developer
    working on web technologies, from the technical details of front-end and back-end coding, to HTTP,
	to career advice, and more.  Its focus is on programming; specifically Ruby and the Rails framework
	on the back-end, and Browser and Javascript related technologies on the front.

	2. The website itself is a Rails app and an open source project, and is constantly evolving with the
	help of students, and of course direction from the founder/developer of the site 
	[Erik Trautman]().

	We use agile inspired methodology to run sprints to implement speced out features, often pairing or 
	in a group, to write test-driven code.  You get to exercise what you learn in the curriculum in a 
	real production app - you can see your work on line literally the next day. See the 
	[Contribution Page on Odin](http://www.theodinproject.com/contributing).


### We are here to learn **Ruby on Rails**
// Show screenshot of [Rails section of Odin](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons)
- We want to take a deep dive so that we can implement our own apps.  No one tutorial can go in as deep as we need; not even Hartl's.  We have to use a variety of resources, over a range of time.

- Our knowledge & learning of Rails will go in ever-increasing concentric circles where we cover the same material over and over again from different angles, each time getting a bigger understanding of the picture.  

	So really, we're here to learn Rails and all the periphery technology that it entails.

- Week 1 had a scheduling snafu! All the participants were advanced beginners; most are already experienced students of Odin's curriculum.  


### What are the skill levels of the participants this week?
// How many people of each of are there?
	
- I expect some total beginners, a few I've-done-a-tutorials, and maybe a couple of intermediates.

- Total Noobs, especially those who havent read the 
	[How this Course Will Work](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/how-this-course-will-work)
	need to do so to cover the pre-reqs to get the most out of our efforts.  You can follow along at will, but you might hurt from lack of programming/Ruby knowledge that you get from earlier course material.

- Hope-fully some have rails installed and have at least started a tutorial, know some rails.  They need to 
	read the How this course will work, and finish Hartl's Chpt 2.  Do Rails Guides' and Blogger2 tutorials.

- Folks from last week are all at least advanced beginners. Hang tight, I'll address you guy specifically a little later.



### Identify Your Group to know which assignments to do...
// I'm assuming there's going to be a split between these two types...

#### You're a Beginner if ...

- Have not coded much in Ruby at all / Have done less than 7 chapters in Hartl / Don't know the difference between client and server / don't know difference between HTTP and MVC / ...


#### You're an Advanced Beginner if ...

- Even though you have to look up specifics, you're comfortable with Ruby / You've completed either the Rails Guide's Getting Started tutorial or JumpStart Lab Blogger2, or at least 6 chapters in Hartl / ...



### Any questions on Installation, Rails in general, Nitrous, ... ?
// Pull up a logged in session of Nitrous, show code editor, ...
- Quick explanation of how Nitrous is nice for collaboration efforts;

- Get a GitHub account asap.  

- Read [my advice from last week](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-transcript.md#advice).

### Time for this weeks [**Points to Ponder**](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-pointsToPonder.md)


### This weeks assignment for Beginners

- Read [How this Course Will Work](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/how-this-course-will-work)
    to get oriented and understand the prep-work you should cover.

- Read [Last week's transcript](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-transcript.md),
 it includes what was covered, links, ... 

    I comment about how you *do* really need to have Ruby knowledge for Rails. So at minimum, ...
    
    **Do [Learn To Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)**, chapter 1 - 10.  It's quick, it'll raise your understanding of Ruby.  Also this synchronizes you with the Odin Wed Dev 101 study group if you care to jump in there as well.
    
    Do chapters 1 & 2 of [Hartl's Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book); gets your feet wet.  You can skip the material on installation if you're already set up.
    
    If you're finished with these already, do [last weeks assignments]().



### Let's [go over last weeks assignment]()



### This weeks assignment for Advanced Beginners

- We've all done at least a bunch of chapters in Hartl... What do you think is the hardest stuff to learn?

	Testing (syntax, what to test, what not to test, when to test)

	Associations

	what else??

- Let's get well grounded in testing and RSpec. Read [Odin's Project Ruby page](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby) and **Do at least the first 7 [Test First Ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby) problems**.
	The goal of this exercise is to get comfortable with RSpec.  We're taken out of the context of Rails and left to deal with just spec-driven Ruby.

	After you finish, read this [BetterSpecs.org RSpec best-practices article](http://betterspecs.org/).

- Kick off our Hartl efforts.  Do chapters 1 & 2.  After you finish chpt 2, think about what tests you would
write.
