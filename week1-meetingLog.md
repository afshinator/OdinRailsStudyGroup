### Rails Study Group Week 1 Hangout log

- [Week 1 Hangout Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GcvIf-sFe4)

---

Well, this first week it turns out that not only did I mess up the date (a week too late) on the hangout, but I didn't realize that my google account wasn't yet set up to host a 'air hangout'.  Google really makes you jump through hoops!   But thanks to Erik, we recorded the session fine.

Everybody who showed up has done at least a few chapters in Hartl.  No total noobs.   I don't think that's going to be the case next week, but here is what we decided to conquer this week regardless:

#### Assignment 1

- Do the [Rails Guides intro project](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

- Do the [Jumpstart Lab Blogger 2 project](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

- Add and use the [annotate_models gem](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models) in one or both of these projects.

- Read [Setting up a Rails app for TDD](http://www.startuprocket.com/blog/how-to-setup-a-rails-app-for-test-driven-and-behavior-driven-development-with-rspec-and-capybara-webkit) article.

- AND of course, **don't forget to read and do** stuff from [How This Course Will Work](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/how-this-course-will-work).


#### Some resources mentioned

- [Rails IRC channel](http://irc.lc/freenode/rails)



#### Also, some stuff I forgot to ask/tell you guys:

- Keep track of how long it takes you to finish each project

- if you have time, check out the other codeboxes out there like Koding, Codebox, etc... let me know your experience.

- Bottom part of [the transcript for this week](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-transcript.md) has a few items I forgot to go over.


#### Next week  

- Go over projects assigned

- Depends on presence of noobs, review [points to ponder](https://github.com/afshinator/OdinRailsStudyGroup/blob/master/week1-pointsToPoinder.md) again with more clarity around HTTP requests and how they work.

- ?? suggestions ??  mail me!

##### I expect to back-track a little next week as newcomers come in.  Thats fine.
